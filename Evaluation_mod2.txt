MODULE 2 – TEMPLATE MATCHING EVALUATION METRICS

This document contains the quantitative evaluation of the Template
Matching Module using two primary performance metrics. These metrics
assess how accurately the detected object matches the true object
location and size.

  --------------------
  EVALUATION METRICS
  --------------------

1.  Center Localization Error (pixels): This metric measures the
    Euclidean distance between the center of the Ground Truth (GT)
    bounding box and the center of the detected bounding box. Lower
    values indicate better localization accuracy. Formula: Error = sqrt(
    (x_d - x_gt)^2 + (y_d - y_gt)^2 )

2.  Scale Deviation (%): This metric measures how much the detected
    bounding box area deviates from the true bounding box area. Lower
    values indicate better scale consistency with the true object size.
    Formula: Deviation = |Area_detected - Area_GT| / Area_GT * 100

  INTERPRETATION
  ----------------

-   Objects with lower center error such as the Purple Tube, Blue Box,
    and Book demonstrate high spatial localization accuracy.
-   Large objects with cluttered backgrounds such as the Pink Box and
    Wallet show higher localization error and greater scale deviation.
-   Scale deviation correlates with occlusion and background noise in
    several cases.
-   The best-performing detections were observed for rigid, textured,
    and well-isolated objects.
-   The weakest performance was seen for highly cluttered and
    low-contrast objects.

  ------------
  CONCLUSION
  ------------

The multi-scale template matching approach performs reliably for rigid,
high-texture objects with minimal background clutter. Performance
degrades with increasing occlusion, rotation, and background complexity,
particularly affecting scale consistency.

This evaluation validates the robustness of the Module 2 implementation
under moderate real-world conditions.
